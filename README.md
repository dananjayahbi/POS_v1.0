â”œâ”€â”€ coffee_pos.db          # SQLite database (created automatically)
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Usage

1. **Start the application**: Run `python main.py`
2. **Navigate**: Use the sidebar icons to switch between different sections
3. **Create orders**: Click on products to add them to the current order
4. **Customize items**: Select product options like milk type, size, etc.
5. **Process payment**: Click "Charge" to complete the order

## Database

The application uses SQLite for data storage with the following main tables:
- `products` - Product catalog
- `orders` - Order history
- `order_items` - Individual order items
- `customers` - Customer information
- `inventory` - Stock management
- `users` - Staff accounts

## Lazy Loading Features

- **Images**: Product images are loaded asynchronously from Unsplash
- **UI Components**: Tabs and panels are loaded only when accessed
- **Data**: Product lists support infinite scroll with pagination
- **Modules**: Python modules are imported only when needed

## Customization

### Adding Products
Products can be added by modifying the dummy data in `database/db_manager.py` or through the admin interface.

### Changing Themes
The application uses ttkbootstrap themes. You can change the theme by modifying the `themename` parameter in `main.py`.

### Custom Product Images
Replace Unsplash URLs in the database with your own product images.

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Create new modules in the `modules/` directory
2. Add database tables in `db_manager.py`
3. Register new tabs in the main application

### Testing
- Dummy data is automatically generated for testing
- The application includes sample orders, customers, and inventory

## Troubleshooting

**Images not loading**: Check internet connection for Unsplash images
**Database errors**: Delete `coffee_pos.db` to regenerate with fresh dummy data
**Import errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Future Enhancements

- Receipt printing
- Barcode scanning
- Advanced reporting
- Multi-location support
- Cloud synchronization
- Customer loyalty programs
